Homemade Vanilla Pudding

Ingredients:

2 cups of milk
1/2 cup of granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons of cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
Instructions:

In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch, and salt.

In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs until well beaten.

Gradually whisk the milk into the egg mixture until smooth.

Pour the egg and milk mixture into the saucepan with the dry ingredients. Whisk to combine.

Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil. This should take about 5-7 minutes.

Once the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.

Pour the pudding into serving dishes or ramekins.

Cover the surface of the pudding with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming.

Refrigerate the pudding for at least 2 hours or until it's chilled and set.

Serve the homemade vanilla pudding chilled, and you can garnish it with whipped cream or fruit if desired. Enjoy your delicious dessert!

This recipe is easy to make and uses milk, eggs, and sugar to create a creamy and comforting vanilla pudding.
